/** A GorillaSuperBlock is a binary format for storing a long
  * [[io.sqooba.oss.timeseries.TimeSeries]] composed of many GorillaBlocks. It
  * uses a sequential layout with an index to permit quick look-up of individual
  * blocks by timestamp.
  *
  * GorillaSuperBlock Format
  * +-------+-------+ ... +----- -+-------+---+----------+---+
  * | block | block |     | block | Index | L | Thrift   | L |
  * | 1     | 2     |     | N     |       | I | metadata | T |
  * +-------+-------+ ... +-------+-------+---+----------+---+
  *
  * LT: length of Thrift block, LI: length of index
  *
  * The Gorilla blocks are lined up one after another, ordered by timestamp.
  * They all have different lengths that can be recovered from the offsets
  * stored in the index.
  *
  * At the end of the stream there is a footer composed of an additional Gorilla
  * array containing the index and a block of thrift managed metadata. The index
  * maps the start timestamp of each GorillaBlock to its offset from the
  * beginning of the blob (in bytes). The last entry in the index points to the
  * start of the footer.
  *
  * The lengths of the index and of the thrift block are written as 4 byte
  * integers just after the respective blocks. In that manner a user can first
  * read the footer, decode the index and then do fast look-ups for blocks by
  * timestamp.
