/**
  * Tooling to efficiently compute aggregates over sliding windows,
  * in contexts where this is possible.
  *
  * Assuming we want to aggregate the content of a window, and to do so for each
  * different window returned by a WindowSlider, many iterations will be required.
  *
  * Depending on the aggregation function, this is however not required:
  *
  * For simple cases like addition or multiplication and any situation
  * where the contributions of a single entry to the aggregated value may
  * be reversed, we can compute an aggregated value for each window in
  * linear time.
  *
  * The reversible aggregator will be applied sequentially, so it may
  * keep track of any state from one addition or removal to the next.
  *
  * @tparam T the type of the entries being aggregated over
  * @tparam A the type of the aggregated value
