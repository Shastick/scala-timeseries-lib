  /** Merge two time series together, using the provided merge operator.
    *
    * The passed TSEntry sequences will be merged according to the merge operator,
    * which will always be applied to one of the following:
    *    - two defined TSEntries with exactly the same domain of definition
    *    - a defined entry from A and None from B
    *    - a defined entry from B and None from A
    *    - No defined entry from A nor B.
    *
    * Overlapping TSEntries in the sequences a and b are trimmed to fit
    * one of the aforementioned cases before being passed to the merge function.
    *
    * For example,
    *    - if 'x' and '-' respectively represent the undefined and defined parts of a TSEntry
    *    - '|' delimits the moment on the time axis where a change in definition occurs either
    * in the present entry or in the one with which it is currently being merged
    *    - 'result' is the sequence resulting from the merge
    *
    * We apply the merge function in the following way:
    *
    * a_i:    xxx|---|---|xxx|xxx
    * b_j:    xxx|xxx|---|---|xxx
    *
    * result: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)
    *
    * (1),(5) : op(None, None)
    * (2) : op(Some(a_i.value), None)
    * (3) : op(Some(a_i.value), Some(b_j.value))
    * (4) : op(None, Some(b_j.value))
    *
    * Assumes a and b to be ORDERED!
    *
    * @param compress specifies whether the entries should be validated and compressed
    *                 by a TSEntryFitter. This should only be omitted if the entries
    *                 will be passed to a TimeSeriesBuilder subsequently.
