#scala-timeseries-lib â€” a lightweight time series library

Easily manipulate and query time-series like data. Useful for manipulating series of discrete values associated to a validity or time-to-live duration, like sensor measures for example.

This library exposes time series as functions that have a value depending on time. Time series may also be undefined for certain time intervals. Operators may be applied between time series, the simple ones being addition and multiplication, while custom ones that can be applied between arbitrary types are easy to implement.

This library is not intended to provide in-depth statistics about time series data, only to make manipulating and querying it easy, without any kind of approximation.

## Usage
In essence, a `TimeSeries` is just an ordered map of `[Long,T]`. In most use cases the Key represents the time since the epoch in milliseconds, but the implementation makes no assumption about the time unit of the key.


### Defining a `TimeSeries`
The `TimeSeries` trait has one main implementation: `VectorTimeSeries[T]`, referring to the underlying collection holding the data.

```
val tsv = VectorTimeSeries(
              1000L -> ("One", 1000L),   // String 'One' lives at 1000 on the timeline and is valid for 1000.
              2000L -> ("Two", 1000L),
              4000L -> ("Four", 1000L))
              
```
`tsv` now defines a time series of Strings that is defined on the `[1000,5000[` interval, with a hole at `[3000,4000[`

### Querying
The simplest function exposed by a time series is `at(t: Long): Option[T]`. With `ts` defined as above, calling `at()`yields the following results:

```
    ts.at(999)  // None
    ts.at(1000) // Some("One")
    ts.at(1999) // Some("One")
    ts.at(2000) // Some("Two")
    ts.at(3000) // None
    ts.at(3999) // None
    ts.at(4000) // Some("Four")
    ts.at(4999) // Some("Four")
    ts.at(5000) // None
```
### Basic Operations
`TimeSeries` of any `Numeric` type come with basic operators you might expect for such cases:

```
val tsa = VectorTimeSeries(
        0L -> (1.0, 10L),
        10L -> (2.0, 10L))  
        
val tsb = VectorTimeSeries(
        0L -> (3.0, 10L),
        10L -> (4.0, 10L))
        
tsa + tsb // (0L -> (4.0, 10l), 10L -> (6.0, 10L))
tsa * tsb // (0L -> (3.0, 10l), 10L -> (8.0, 10L))

```

Note that there are a few quirks to be aware of when a TimeSeries has discontinuities: please refer to function comments in `NumericTimeSeries.scala` (living in `ch.shastick`) for more details.

### Custom Operators: Time Series Merging
For non-numeric time series, or for any particular needs, a `TimeSeries` can be merged using an arbitrary merge operator: `op: (Option[A], Option[B]) => Option[C]`. For example:

```
def plus(aO: Option[Double], bO: Option[Double]) = 
    (aO, bO) match {
      // Wherever both time series share a defined domain, return the sum of the values
      case (Some(a), Some(b)) => Some(a+b) 
      // Wherever only a single time series is defined, return the defined value
      case (Some(a), None) => aO
      case (None, Some(b)) => bO
      // Where none of the time series are defined, the result remains undefined.
      case _ => None
    }
```

For a complete view of what you can do with a `TimeSeries`, the best is to have a look at the `TimeSeries.scala` trait living in `ch.shastick`.

### Under the hood
While a `TimeSeries[T]` looks a lot like an ordered `Map[Long,T]`, it should more be considered like an ordered collection of triples of the form `(timestamp, value, validity)` (called a `TSEntry[T]` internally), representing small, constant, time series chunks.
## Notes on Performance

As suggested by its name, `VectorTimeSeries` is backed by a `Vector` and uses dichotomic search for lookups. The following performances can thus be expected (using the denomination [found here](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/collections/performance-characteristics.html)):

  - `Log` for random lookups, left/right trimming and slicing within the definition bounds
  - `eC` (effectively constant time) for the rest (appending, prepending, head, last, ...)

## Why 
I've had to handle time series like data in Java recently, which turned out to be ~~slightly~~ really frustrating.

Having some spare time and wanting to see what I could come up with in Scala, I decided to build a small time series library. Additional reasons are:

  - It's fun
  - There seems to be no library doing something like that out there
  - I wanted to write some Scala again.

## TODOS
  - updatable time-series (ala mutable collection style)
  - compression (at least for strict equality) when new entries are appended
  - review trait function implementations for efficiency? (ie, split/slice. Slice at least could be a stupid wrapper checking the bounds?)
  - decent tests for non-trivial merge operators
  - default Seq implementation (and the one that is imported) is mutable -> consider the implications and see if we can easily fix this by 'import scala.collection.immutable.Seq' everywhere required.
  - input validation when applying. Check entries sorted (for the vector TS) and without overlap.
  - Have empty time series always be represented by an EmptyTimeSeries. (Ie, wrapping an empty vector in a time-series should not happen)
  - Have single-entry time series always be represented by a TSEntry
  - Generic tests for any kind of TS implementation
  - benchmarks to actually compare various implementations.
  - make it easy to use from Java
  - consider https://scalacheck.org/ for property-based testing ? (especially for ordering-related tests?)
